# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This SPA displays houses, people and quotes from the series Game
of Thrones (GOT). The API https://gameofthronesquotes.xyz/ has been used. The following
features are implemented:
- In the navigation area, the items "Houses", " Persons", "Quotes" are present;
- A searchable list of all houses from GOT should be displayed under "Houses". If you click on the
name of a house, the members of that house are displayed on a subpage.
- A searchable list of all persons from GOT, including the associated house, should be displayed
under "Persons". If you click on the name of a person, details about this person are displayed on
a subpage (name, house, quotations).
- Furthermore, there should be a button that replaces the list of quotations of this person with
other quotations.
- In the "Quotes" section, there is a list of five quotes by default. The user can use a button to
replace this list with five other random quotes.
